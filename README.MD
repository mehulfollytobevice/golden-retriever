# Golden Retriever: In-house RAG system -

__Specific Research Question:__
How can we design and optimize a RAG system to provide personalized, reference-rich outputs for data science teams, while managing in-house packages, in an offline environment?

To break it down further:
- __Customized Output with References:__ Investigate how the RAG system can leverage context-specific information to generate tailored outputs for data scientists. Explore methods to include accurate and relevant references in the generated content.
- __In-House Offline System:__ Examine the technical requirements and constraints of deploying a RAG system in an offline environment. Assess the challenges related to data storage, processing, and model updates without internet connectivity.
- __Managing In-House Packages:__ Analyze strategies for integrating and managing proprietary data science packages within the RAG system. Look into the compatibility issues, version control, and dependency management to ensure seamless operation and integration.
